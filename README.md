# Session 3 Capstone: Build an API
In this project, we will use what we know about Node.js, MongoDB, and Express to create a RESTful API. This starter provides basic functionality for authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), interaction with a MongoDB using Mongoose, and the start of an OpenAPI specification for documentation presented through swagger. 

## Basic Requirements
**Your api should include the following functionality in order to be considered complete:**
 
 - At least 2 addtional resource or endpoints in addition to the Users and Auth
 - At least 1 addtional route for a resource that requires authentication
 - At least one route for every CRUD operation should represented across all of your resources or endpoints (does not have to be on all resources)
 - Return proper HTTP status codes for API requests
 - Use validation on your Mongoose Models [Built-in validation docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html#built-in-validators)
 - Make an attempt to maintain the OpenAPI Specification for the Swagger documentation [Online Swagger Editior](https://editor.swagger.io/)
 - Ensure all endpoints work with Postman or similar HTTP Client

**Other Requirements**

- Your repository must contain the appropriate git commit history
    - Typically a commit for each meaningful piece of work completed
- Each user in the group should work on their own branches and create a PR to merge their changes into master
- Maintain a project board outlining and prioritizing the user stories and tasks needed to create your minimum viable product (MVP) for your API
